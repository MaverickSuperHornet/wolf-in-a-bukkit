Wolf-in-a-bukkit
================

Wolf in a bukkit is intended to be an X11/MIT API for the LGPL CraftBukkit, to allow programs as CraftBukkit, Spigot and Cauldron to continue to exist and be downloaded.

This package will be REVERSE ENGINERED in functionality from the CraftBukkit code.

IT IS FORBIDDEN TO LOOK INTO THE BUKKIT API FOR CODE OR HOW IT WORKS!

Any code re-used from the Bukkit code will be deleted!

YOU CANNOT BASE IDEAS OF FUNCTIONALITY OFF BUKKIT API CODE!

This is also a derived work which falls under Copyright law.

You are only allowed to look into Craftbukkit AND plugins to see how it is supposed to work.
We will have to add new functionalities we might have missed based on bug reports.

PLEASE ADHERE TO THESE RULES! This is the only way we can make this work.

In the code add commentary where you based the idea off. File name in Craftbukkit or plugin and line number reference mandatory OR bug report!.
We need a paper trail to show we DID NOT LOOK INTO BUKKIT for functionality.
Also make notes of your reasoning you have behind the functionality. This does not have to be long but more in the line like:
    x.java implemented yyy, interface yyy needed.
    x.java has a variable that takes an int from a method called getGreen() from Color object; public int getGreen() needed in Color object


I realise this is really a handicapped project but it is doable. Better than rewriting an API from scratch.

To make the situation clear: ANYTHING USING BUKKIT API CANNOT BE USED WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN GPLv3 SOFTWARE!

Okay, so we have this clear, lets get cracking and make sure plugins like dynmap, essentials and stuff get a headway.

Files will be in the org.bukkit package to ensure maximum compatiblity with existing plugins.
We will try to re-create the hooks and classes to the best of our abilities.

The only headway I am willing to give us is blank files corresponding files in the bukkit api. What goes in the files must be deduced from craftbukkit code.

FOR THIS PROJECT A CRAFTBUKKIT WILL BE PROVIDED STRIPPED OF BUKKIT API!
This project will have to compile against wolf in a bukkit.
THEREFORE THE CODE WILL HAVE REFERENCES TO org.bukkit code but that will WOLF IN A BUKKIT CODE
